Main packages:

- stage
- model
- dataset
- utils

To do:

- specify tensorflow versions, tensorflow v2 should be preferred
- import checks should be done
- library call should be done

Tests to be done:
- train on test_data (v)
- run trainings using different stage transforms to have coverage
- train denoising on test_data
- summarize all models
- add Loss for training denoising models
- (...) - add postprocessing@sg


Generally - some ordering...
